# Minecraft Server Dockerized

## Client: http://api.technicpack.net/modpack/imblying76

### This is a very raw version, if you wish to use it as your own server, you will need to switch the volume of the docker to your own. Why is it important? If you skip this step, all your saves will restart once the server restarts
